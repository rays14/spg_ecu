BUG IN VIVADO GENERATED IP MAKEFILES
-------------------------------------
When creating IP with Vivado the driver make files don't parse the *.c *.h and
*.o files correctly.

See the file 1198158_001_Makefile.txt for how to fix this.
INCLUDEFILES=*.h
LIBSOURCES=*.c
OBJECTS = $(addsuffix .o, $(basename $(wildcard *.c)))
ASSEMBLY_OBJECTS = $(addsuffix .o, $(basename $(wildcard *.S)))

If this does not work then replace *.c, *.h and *.o with the names of the
driver h/c/o files manually and that fixes the problem on Windows. This should
work on Linux though.
INCLUDEFILES=ip_m_pwm.h
LIBSOURCES=ip_m_pwm.c ip_m_pwm_selftest.c
OBJECTS=ip_m_pwm.o
ASSEMBLY_OBJECTS="DO the same for the assembly files accordingly"
